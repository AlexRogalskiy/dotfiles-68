Re: Board of Psychology Control No. 6002014000541

Ladies and Gentlemen:

I have yours of December 3, 2014, requesting information for an informal review
of the captioned matter regarding Mr. Gregory Stockman.  The following is my
response

## Background

I serve as a staff psychologist at the Napa State Hospital. 

The patient was committed to the California Department of State hospitals by
Sonoma County on June 28, 1993, initially at the Atascadero State Hospital. 
He was admitted pursuant to PC 1026, as Not Guilty by Reason of Insanity for 
First Degree Murder and Assault with a Deadly Weapon.  He was later 
transferred to the Napa State Hospital.

Mr. Stockman is presently diagnosed with Schizoaffective Disorder Bipolar Type 
(DSM 295.70), Severe Alcohol Use Disorder with Phsysiological Dependence,
in Remission (DSM 303.90.1), and a Personality Disorder Not Otherwise Specified
(Traits of Paranoid Personality Disorder, Obsessive and Compulsive Personality 
Disorder and Narcissistic Personality Disorder (DSM 301.89).

He was discharged to Sonoma County CONREP on September 6, 2001, but his 
admission to CONREP was recoked on June 7, 2006 because of nondisclosure of
financial transactions, seeing his daughter without permission and other rule
violations.

Mr. Stockman was transferred to an open discharge unit on May 23, 2013, but was
transferred to a locked unit in late July of that year after refusing to meet
with CONREP and revoking a power of attorney granted to one, Jan Jack.  He
claimed to have filed a lawsuit against Sonoma CONREP and certain of its
employees, and refused to revoke the power of attorney to Jan Jack.

Mr. Stockman came into my care in an open unit on or about March 17, 2014. I
served as the Psychologist on his treatment team in that unit, and he 
participated in one of my groups.  While
there, he continuesd to exhibit active symptoms of psychosis in relationship to
CONREP and its revocation of his outpatient treatment.  Additionally, he refused
to take medication prescribed by his attending psychiatrist (risperdal) for
those syptoms.  As a result, he was transferred from the open unit to a closed
unit on July 29, 2014.  I have had no significant interactions with him since
that time, although I have been informed I may be asked to testify at a hearing
with respect to his inpatient status at the Napa State Hospital.

## Patient's Allegations

As set forth in the Letter, the Mr. Stockman alleged that I have:

> A. Authored a June 2014 HCR-20 Risk for Violence Assessment concerning Mr. 
Stockman, however he was never interviewed for this assessment

> B. Caused Mr. Stockman grievous mental anguish when at his July 29, 2014 
transfer conference you stated to Mr. Stockman that he has been paranoid and 
delusional with persecutory thoughts and a thought disorder for the past eight 
years, and that since he has been there, he has exhibited major psychotic 
features.

### HRC-20 

Pursuant to Hospital policy, I conducted a file review and interview to complete
an HCR-20 on or about ???, 2014 in connection with NSH policies.  
Although the Chief of Psychology here does not require a specific inteview to 
complete an HCR-20 when a psychologist has sufficient information from clinical
observations and record reviews, it is my practice to conduct such an 
interview, and I followed that practice in this case.  In particular, Mr.
Stockman submitted to an HCR-20 interview in my office on ????, 2014, at which
time I recorded his answers in a draft HCR-20 report form, which was later 
expanded to the final version of the report.  A copy of that file is enclosed
as Exhibit "A."

Accordingly, the allegation that the HCR-20 was completed without an interview 
is unfounded.

### Statements Regarding Psychotic Features 

Mr. Stockman has been diagnosed with and prescribed medication for
Schizoaffective Disorder Bipolar Type.  His refusal to take medication for his
condition was one reason for his transfer to the closed unit.  It is my practice 
to explain the reasons for a transfer to a more restrictive unit.  This is done
so the patient can ore quickly return to an open or discharge unit.

Accordingly, I did inform Mr. Stockman concerning his diagnosis, 
and the reasons for his transfer. His lack of insight into his condition and 
refusal of medication has been and will continue to be a significant 
impediment to his ultimate release.  While this information (and the transfer) 
may have been unwelcome to him, at no time was it my intent to cause harm or 
injury.
