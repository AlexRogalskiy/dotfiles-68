Comments on Proposed Amendments to the Rules and Regulations
============================================================

Process: Governed by Article XIV of the Bylaws.
-----------------------------------------------

-   **Must be Consistent with Bylaws** Or requires the Amendment Process
    and Notice.

-   **Quorum and 2/3 Vote** Requires a quorum present, and then a
    two-thirds vote of those present.

-   **Notice** Notice is not required for a Bylaws-compliant Rule.
    However, why not give the Medical Staff adequate notice to review
    before springing it on us?




## What is an FPPE?  What Existing Rules and Regulations Exist?

*  What is it?  How long does it last?  Who conducts it?  

*  What provisions are there for notice and an opportunity to
   challenge referral?  An appeal of a negative response?
   An appeal by adverse determinations by the FPPE proctor,
   or whatever?

*  What provisions are there for participation and documentation
   of the process?

*  Where will those records be kept?  Will the Board comply with
   rules for adverse process? 

## Administration Intervention With Medical Staff?

*  Is the administration ever going to be involved with an
   FPPE review?  Why would the Med Staff cede authority
   over medical competence questions?

## We already have a Peer Review Process.  Why is this necessary?

## Proctoring versus FPPE.

*  Why should people seeking privileges be submitted to FPPE.

*  Privileging already requires proctoring, why is more needed?

## No Due Process Protections.

*   Both Peer Review and Privileging Processes Have Appeal and Fair Hearing 
    Provisions to assure fairness.  This allows referral to the Administration
    (Chief of Psychology) without review.  Particularly when it is linked
    to privileging, it seems inconsistent with the Bylaws and at least requires
    notice before Amending those provisions thorugh a ""back door."
