-   **Recovery of Prelitigation Fees** ∆s reliance on *Brandt* and *Hsu*
    for the proposition that fees denied as damages could not be
    recovered as fees confuses me. No statutory or logical analysis is
    provided. *Brandt* reverses and order denying awards, and *Hsu* is a
    prevailing party case. The claim that "recasting" is disingenuous is
    simply name-calling. Then, we claimed she was injured by incurring
    fees to survive as a Psychologist and keep her job. Now, we claimed
    that she is entitled to an award of fees. There is no reason that
    they could not be either or both, except that ∆s claim, ipse dixit,
    that it is not so.


-   ** Greenberg paralegal fees** ∆s claim it is "virtually impossible" to
    distinguish my billings from time spent as a client.  No distinction
    is necessary: I wasn't a client, and I didn't bill for time communicating
    with Dr. Samuelson in any capacity, much less than an agent.  (One exception
    is that I did bill or my time preparing her for her testimony.)   It is
    stightforward to make the distinction.  If it was a line item, then it was 
    for time in the capacity of a paralegal  Period.

*   **Greenberg Testimony** 

    * I wasn't an agent for Dr. S,
    and don't recall testifying that I did.  

    * They allege, without evidence or citation that my work might have
    been unnecessary or duplicative.  We have declarations from me and Kirk
    stating that it was not.  And absolute necessity is not required anyway.
    The value of the work isn't at question -- the question is whether the
    work was done.  I already testified under oath that it was

    * Further, I did testify that 
    I had no financial interest in the case, so claims that I am seeking 
    improper __pro se__ fee awards is inaccurate. Hence, I was never doing 
    work as a client --
    all my billing is for work as a paralegal. 

    * Finally, ∆
    mischaracterized my testimony concerning to save costs. Under
    Melody's fee agreement, she would pay out of pocket costs of the
    litigation as, for example was the case with Mr. Hayes.
    Had I not provided my services, the Firm would have
    engaged a contract paralegal, and I would have to pay those costs
    on a non-contingent basis with money we did not have, 
    or Melody would have the consequences of
    not having this work done.  My volunteering that work for free does not
    affect recoverability, under the cases already cited.
