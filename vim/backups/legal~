V. SUPREME COURT AND IP/Techlaw

• Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons. At issue is whether a former grad student is liable for infringement for selling textbooks in the United States on eBay that he purchased cheaply overseas.

• Bowman v. Monsanto Co. At issue is whether an Indiana farmer is liable for infringement because he planted herbicide-resistant second-generation soybean seeds purchased from a grain elevator.

• Gunn v. Minton. At issue is whether federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction in legal malpractice cases involving patent law.

• Already LLC v. Nike. At issue is whether a federal court has jurisdiction in a trademark challenge if the registrant promises not to assert the mark against the opposing party's existing commercial activities. The cert petition (PDF) includes drawings of two sets of athletic shoes, one depicting the asserted trademark and the other the “accused shoe.” Nike had claimed infringement by Already, the maker of YUMS shoes, then dropped its suit and agreed not to sue when Already challenged Nike’s trademark, according to a story published earlier this year by Thomson Reuters News & Insight.
