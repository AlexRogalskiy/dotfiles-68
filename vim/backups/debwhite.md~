Q.  DO YOU AGREE WITH THE DEFINITION OF FORENSIC PSYCHOLOGY PROVIDED IN THE APA SPECIALTY GUIDELINES?
    p. 3 "For the purposes of these *Guidelines*, forensic psychology refers to the professional practice by
    any psychologist working within any sub-discipline o psychology ... when applying the scientific,
    technical or specialized knowledge of psychology to the law to assist in addressing contractual and
    administrative matters.

Q.  THE FORENSIC GUILDELINES HAVE A SECTION ON ASSESSMENT?  SECTION 10?

Q.  THE GUIDELINES STATE THAT FORENSIC PRACTITIONERS USE ASSESSMENT INSTRUMENTS WHOSE VALIIDTY AND RELIABILITY
HAVE BEEN FIRMLY ESTABLISHED FOR USE WITH MEMBERS OF THE POPULATION ASSESSED.  WHEN SUCH VALIDITY AND RELIABILITY
HAVE NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED, FORENSIC PRACTITIONERS CONSIDER AND DESCRIBE THE STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THEIR
FINDINGS?

Q.  THE FORENSIC GUIDELINES HAVE A SECTION ON GIVING OPINIONS TO COURTS?  SECTION 11? 

Q. THE GUIDELINES REQUIRE COMPREHENSIVE AND ACCURATE PRESENTATION OF OPINIONS IN REPORTS AND TESTIMONY? 11.04

Q. THAT MEANS DISCLOSING THE SCOPE OF YOUR WORK, AND INDICATING FACTORS SUPPORTING AND OTHERWISE?

Q. YOU CLAIMED IN YOUR TESTIMONY AGAINST DR. SAMUELSON THAT, EVEN THOUGH DR. SAMUELSON DIDN'T SAY THE
WORDS "FORENSIC PRIVILEGE," SHE WAS STILL OBLIGED TO STATE THAT THE THINGS SHE DID WERE SUBJECT TO
SUPERVISION, IS THAT RIGHT?

Q. AND YOU TESTIFIED THAT YOU READ EVERY PAGE OF THE TRANSCRIPT, ISN'T THAT SO?

Q. ALL 365 PAGES TO FORM YOUR OPINION.

Q. BUT YOU DIDN'T POINT OUT TO THE COURT THAT DR. SAMUELSON EXPRESSLY STATED THAT SHE
HAD DIRECT SUPERVISORS, DID YOU?

Q. AND YOU DIDN'T POINT OUT TO THE COURT THAT DR. SAMUELSON EXPRESSSLY STATED THAT SHE
WAS UNLICENSED, DID YOU?

Q. AND WHEN ASKED, YOU DIDN'T ADMIT THAT THE WORDS "FORENSIC PRIVILEGE" DO NOT APPEAR
IN THE TRANSCRIPT, DID YOU?

Q. AND YOU SWORE UNDER OATH THAT AN EMPLOYEE WORKING IN PROGRAM 5 AT THE NAPA STATE HOSPITAL
REQUIRES FULL FORENSIC ASSESSMENT PRIVILEGES TO SCREEN 1370 PATIENTS FOR MALINGERING, DIDN'T YOU?

Q. EVEN THOUGH IT IS COMMON PRACTICE BY ALL PSYCHOLOGISTS TO DO SO AT THE NAPA STATE HOSPITAL?

Q. AND YOU SWORE UNDER OATH THAT AN EMPLOYEE WORKING IN PROGRAM 3 AT THE NAPA STATE HOSPITAL
REQUIRES FULL FORENSIC ASSESSMENT PRIVILEGES TO WRITE COURT ORDERS REPORTING VIOLENCE RISK
POTENTIAL, DIDN'T YOU?

Q. WAS THAT A COMPREHENSIVE AND ACCURATE PRESENTATION OF YOUR OPINION IN THAT CASE?

Q. AND YOU SWORD UNDER OATH YOUR OPINION THAT DR. SAMUELSON WAS BOUND TO, AND SHOULD LOSE
HER JOB, AND WITH IT HER REPUTATION, FOR FAILING TO COMPLY WITH THE SPECIALTY GUIDELINES, IS
THAT RIGHT?

Q. AND YOU CLAIMED THAT IS THE STANDARD IN THE COMMUNITY, IS THAT RIGHT?

Q. BUT YOU DIDN'T TELL THE COURT THAT THE FORENSIC GUIDELINES EXPRESSLY STATED THAT THE GUIDELINES
ARE NOT INTENDED TO SERVE AS A BASIS FOR DISCIPLINARY ACTION OR CIvil LIABILITY WHEN YOU STATED
YOUR OPINION, ISN'T THAT RIGHT?

[EVEN IF SHE ARGUES, SHE DIDN'T TELL THAT TO THE COURT]

Q. AND YOU DIDN'T TELL THE COURT THAT NO ETHICAL, LICENSURE, OR OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION OR
REMEDY SHOULD BE TAKEN FROM THAT, ISN'T THAT RIGHT? 

[EVEN IF SHE ARGUES, SHE DIDN'T TELL THAT TO THE COURT]

Q. ASSUMING THAT WERE TRUE, WOULD THAT BE A COMPREHENSIVE AND ACCURATE PRESENTATION OF YOUR
OPINION TO WITHHOLD THAT INFORMATION?

Q. AND AT THAT HEARING, YOU TESTIFIED THAT THE STATEMENTS MADE BY OFFICER GALLEGOS ACCURATELY
REPORTED YOUR STATEMENTS TO HIM, EXCEPT FOR THE PERIOD OF YOUR PROCTORING, ISN'T THAT RIGHT?

Q. AND YOU TOLD OFFICER GALLEGOS THAT DR. SAMUELSON HAD NO FORENSIC PRIVILEGES, ISN'T THAT RIGHT

1. 2008-02-01 AGO5777-5816 [Ex. 58] Rules and Procedures for Processing Ethics Complaints *at AGO7104*

Q. BUT SHE WAS ENTITLED UNDER HER CORE PRIVILEGES TO PERFORM COMPETENCY ASSESSMENTS, ISN'T THAT RIGHT?

Q. AND YOU DIDN'T TELL OFFICER GALLEGOS THAT THIS WAS SO, DID YOU?

Q. AND SHE HAD PROVISIONAL FORENSIC ASSESSMENT I PRIVILEGES AT THAT TIME, DIDN'T SHE

Q. AND YOU DIDN'T TELL OFFICER GALLEGOS THAT THIS WAS SO, DID YOU?

Q. EVEN THOUGH AS HER PROCTOR, You KNEW SHE HAD THOSE PRIVILEGES.

Q. AND THAT WASN'T A COMPREHENSIVE AND ACCURATE STATEMENT THAT SHE HAD NO
FORENSIC PRIVILEGES AND THAT SHE WAS AWARE OF IT.

Q. AND YOU KNOW THAT THE CHIEF OF PSYCHOLOGY TOLD HER THAT MALINGERING IS A SPECIALTY OF
COMPETENCY ASSESSMENT, DIDN'T YOU?

Q. AND YOU KNOW THAT THE CHIEF OF PSYCHOLOGY COMMENDED HER FOR THAT PERFORMANCE, DIDN'T YOU?

Q. AND YOU KNOW THAT SHE WAS WORKING ON PROGRAM 3, WRITING PPR REPORTS FOR PATIENTS AWAITING
RELEASE TO LESS RESTRICTIVE SETTINGS, RIGHT?

Q. AND THAT HER SUPERVISORS INSTRUCTED HER TO DO SUCH REPORTS?

Q. AND THAT THOSE REPORTS REQUIRE DISCUSSIONS OF VIOLENCE RISK POTENTIAL, DON'T YOU?

Q. AND THAT ALL OR MOST PSYCHOLOGISTS WITHOUT FULL FORENSIC PRIVILEGES PREPARE SUCH
REPORTS WITHOUT SUPERVISION, DON'T YOU?

Q. BUT YOU DIDN'T TELL OFFICER GALLEGOS ABOUT THAT, DID YOU?

Q. AND YOU ARE AWARE THAT ERIN WARNICK AND WENDY HATCHER INFORMED DR. SAMUELSON THAT A FULL FORENSIC PRIVILEGES
IS NOT NECESSARY TO PERFORM HER DUTIES ON PROGRAM 3? 

1. 2009-04-15 AGO5906 Memo Erin Warnick & Wendy Hatcher - JJ Re: Inability to recommend approval for full forensic privilege; "According to the credentials committees privilege and appointment procedures, ...

I have asked them to put these incidents in writing and will forward them to you as I get them.
