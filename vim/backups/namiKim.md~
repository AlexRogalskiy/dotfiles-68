## OUR LITANY ON MALINGERING/VIOLENCE RISK: Usual breakdown of Program 3/5, except Nami is Senior Supervisor in 3 and chair of credentials, so linger here a bit, Adding
Nobody needs special privileges to do general Violence Risk Potential without instruments

She testified "According to our -- The Naa State Hospital's Psychology Credentials Committee, Policies and Procedures, forensic assessment is specifically for violence risk assessments." Limited to "full assessments" that use special instruments, and not routine assessments of Violence Risk Potential.  [pp. 82-83, from 1-19 transcript.]

Asessing Malingering in competency assessments, even with instruments, like TOMM, SIRS, and M/FAST is ok without the specialty privilege?
