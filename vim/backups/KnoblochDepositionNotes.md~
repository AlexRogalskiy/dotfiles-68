#Knobloch Deposition Notes

Kirk,

Attached are notes for tomorrow's deposition.  I am sure you have this stuff pretty much nailed,
but I include them in an abundance of caution.  The First section might not have been on your scope, and
the second basically follows the by-laws strictly, and may be of help. 

The First section addresses significant background issues that we will need from all witnesses as part of our efforts to impeach Deb White's testimony at the SBC hearing.  I anticipate 
affirmative answers from most Psychologists, and Tom is a strong candidate for these questions, as they are not likely to have prepared him on the subject.  The second section is a detailed inquiry of Tom's
Performance procedurally, highlighting deviations from the Bylaws.  The third section addresses the proceedings pursuant
to the bylaws, and I kept it tight, as I am sure you have that area well-covered.  I believe it will be worthwhile to
pursue the question of the redactions in his letters, as I believe they reflect a determination internally that the peer review was
unlawful.  Finally, the fourth is a hail mary inquiry concerning the information we received at the end of last week, just a bit of
fishing there.
