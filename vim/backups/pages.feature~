Feature: Configure Rails to Deliver Static Pages
  As a developer
  I would like to display static pages by name
  So that I could more easily work with designers 
  
  Scenario: Index page
    When I visit the index page
    Then show the page
  
  Scenario: Page is found
    When I visit a page with a file in /app/views/pages
    Then show the page

  Scenario: Page not found
    When I visit a page without a file in app/views/pages
    Then respond with a 404 status code
    
  Scenario: Landing page
    When I visit the all-pages page
    Then I am redirected to the index page

  Scenario: Default page
    When I visit the '/' path
    Then I am redirected to the index page
