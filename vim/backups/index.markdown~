We build applications from an empty file using
test-first disciplines. In homage to the martial arts 
practice of recording techniques by example, we call an
application of the discipline a "kata."

I'll perform a kata in a screencast. With each kata
comes "Bunkai." A Bunkai is a breakdown and analysis 
of the techniques demonstrated, why they were used 
and how they can be applied to your practice.

Then it is your turn to replicate the application.  Correct performance has *nothing to do* with rote repetition.
You find your own chops and improve on the craft with each repetition.

We repeat the Katas to better comprehend the practices and to 
build mental muscle memory so that skills flow quickly from your mind,
as though you were touch-typing the ideas themselves.

I hope these katas inspire you to adopt these terrific agile practices, 
and to change the world by your own example and craftsmanship. 

My name is Andrew Greenberg.
