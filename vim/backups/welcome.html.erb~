<h3>Welecome to ECaseBase!</hr>

Thank you for joining our growing ranks of eCaseBase Users.  We believe we offer a simple, elegant solution to the mire that is modern litigation.  It comes down to this:

<ul>
  <li><b>Lawsuits</b> are determined on the <i><%= link_to "issues", page_url(:issues) %></i>.</li>
  <li><b>Issues</b> are decided by the <i><%= link_to "facts", page_url(:facts) %></i>.</li>
  <li><b>Facts</b> are proved with the <i><%= link_to "evidence", page_url(:evidence) %></i>.</li>
  <li><b>Evidence</b> comprises people, documents and things.</li>
</ul>

Please join us at <A href="http://www.ecasebase.com">ECaseBase</a> soon and see how this all fits together.
We hopes to prove the merits of this simple approach to you, and look forward to your comments about eCaseBase.  

Sincerely,
Andrew C. Greenberg
