Re: 12 Golden Gate Circle

Gloria,

I have your text messages and correspondence with Melody regarding the captioned property.  This letter is written in
hopes of settling an apparent dispute between you and she.  At the outset, may I suggest at the outset that it would be better
for all concerned if we undertook to set emotion aside and resolve this matter in a businesslike fashion?

The emotional nature of your remarks appear inappropriate and non-productive to a prompt settlement.  I should note that
have offended Melody with repeated remarks about her integrity and housekeeping.  This is particularly so, given that in good faith
Melody undertook to spend more than $500 for cleaning the property and repairing flimsy fixtures that should not have broken
upon ordinary use, knowing that you already held a security deposit for the property.  I must add that I see her position clearly.
 
In turn, I do not sure I understand yours.  `Whatever emotional attachment you had to the condo, it was your decision to move for 
personal reasons and rent the property to strangers for income.  The reason you chose not to renew the lease was so you can put 
it on the market for sale.  Suggestions of surprise at the condition of the condo are problematic, given that you frequently visited us, had your realtor
inspect it and concluded a comprehensive walkthrough with Spencer prior to retaking possession. [WAS IT SHE WHO INSISTED ON THE
WALKTHROUGH]
References to "trust" are unhelpful, given that you insisted upon a written lease using the form you supplied and required a
deposit to secure the condition of the property.

The lease is clear about Melody's obligation.  She is obliged only to return possession of the property in the condition she
received it, less reasonable wear and tear.  You demanded a deposit for damages in the amount of $500, and agreed to permit
Melody to live there with her two poodles and demanded an additional $250 deposit, for a total of $750. Now, after living there
for a few years, you are demanding more than a full year's rent in damages.  This is contrary to the letter and spirit of the
lease, and we must reject your offer at this time.

The property was in reasonable condition when we took it, of course, but showed considerable wear as would any property with
appliances and fixtures of its age, and some of it was already broken and damaged.  The carpet was in unserviceable condition, 
so much so that you agreed, in writing, that we would have no responsibility for any damage to it at the end of the lease. 
Many fixtures were in unusable condition with significant damage in cases, while others simply broke with ordinary use.  
We accepted the property, in that condition and maintained a workable relationship throughout the lease.  
It is for this reason that we are concerned about your demands, many of them not mentioned even during the walkthrough.

To be clear, we understand that while you want the property in pristine condition to improve its resale value, we
are under no obligation to make that investment for you.  We have no obligation to replace 10-year old appliances with brand new
appliances, or to paint and refinish hollow wooden doors with entirely new and upgraded doors.  While we agree that some
damages are reasonable, the amount of those damages cannot exceed the value of the property at the time we took it, less depreciation
for their age and a discount for reasonable wear and tear.

Accordingly, without agreeing to any of the claims made in your letter, we are prepared to consider the matter settled for $750, 
the full amount of our deposit, which you may retain if you agree.  If it is still necessary to revisit each line item in your
letter, please advise and we can arrange a meeting for that purpose.

Love, Kisses and Huggerooonies,
Andrew
