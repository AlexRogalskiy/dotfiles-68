# Superheroic Katas

Superheroic Katas in AngularJS.  

Using Test-First disciplines, lets build applications built from scratch, that is starting with an
empty file.  From the simplest examples to full-scale AngularJS and backend systems, I hope these
katas may inspire you to adopt these terrific agile practices to change the world 
with your own examples and craftsmanship. 

I'll perform each kata for you.  Then it is your turn.  
Correct performance has nothing to do with mimicking what I show you, but
by finding your own chops and improving on the craft.  
We repeat katas to better comprehend the practices and to 
build mental muscle memory so that skills flow quickly from your mind, as though you were touch 
typing the ideas themselves. They should take your breath away, as can a Mozart aria. 

My name is Andrew Greenberg, and I would be grateful for your comments and suggestions as you work through these forms.  You can find me by e-mail at wizardwerdna@gmail.com, or at @wizardwerdna on twitter.  Now, let't get this kata started.
