# Napa State Hospital Competency Training Policy

The question is whether a hospital psychologist who has certified restored competency of a patient to stand trial
has failed to apply generally accepted standards of care and/or has violated Ethical Principles of Psychologists Code of Conduct, Section 5.0.1, and/or
APA Forensic Guidelines, Section 11, when certification is based solely upon the hospital's standardized regime, described below.

As practiced at the Napa State Hospital, cerification relies upon a standardized process of: (i) administering
antipsychotic medication; (ii) repetitive "competency training" of subject matter of the Competency Assessment Instrument (CAI), (ii) 
administration of the CAI until the patient has "passed" it, (iii) administration of a non-standardized "mock trial," 
the subject matter of which are the questions of the CAI, and (iv) a consensus reached by an interdisciplinary
team at a meeting.  Upon passage of this regime, the pscyhologist would sign a letter to a Court certifying competence.
The CAI would be administered periodically throughout their stay until it has been learned.  
A patient who "failed" "competency training" would typically repeat the process until passing,
or until the passage of a three year statutory period for conservation.

While the Hospital maintains that normed and standardized testing may be conducted in addition to the standardized 
competency training process, psychologists are nevertheless bound to present their analysis first in terms of the 
patient's responsiveness to the questions of the CAI under hospital policy.  There is no written policy expressly 
permitting the use of other tests, and Psychologists have been subjected to peer review panels for deviating from 
the "standarized" policy, and applying normed and standardized tests instead.

This process has been standardized pursuant to hospital policy, expressly for the purpose of
reducing the "Length of Stay" for patients committed as not competent to stand trial.  
At times, the CAI would be administered by persons other than psychologists and psychiatrists. The Mock
Trial was almost always scripted by persons other than a psychologist or psychiatrist.
