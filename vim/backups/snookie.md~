#INTRODUCING The Revised-CAI; 
"Grisso (1986) notes that certain distortion, i.e. malingering, should be taken into consideration when developing FAIs."  Recommending SIRS.
*Instruments such as the "Revised CAI are not 'tests,', but rather a semi-structured interview format assisting in addressing the functional abilities of a defendant a given legal context."*

There is no true cut-off score on the Revised Competency Assessment Instrument that indicates a defendant is trial competent.  One must be rather cautious applying any total number in evaluating a defedant's competency.  Trial competency is a hypothetical construct which can be measured only in relation to the defendant's legal predicament (Roesch and Golding, 1980).  . . . . A defendant charged with a capital offense generally must display more strengths than weaknesses to be considered trial competent. . . . For example, a defendant charged with homicide needs to fully appreciate the terms and ramifications of all possible pleas, whereas the defendant who did not pay for a meal seldom has to display an appreciation for the insanity defense. jj, nk, dw, 1370, cai
